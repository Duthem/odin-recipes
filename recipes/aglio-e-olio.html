        <h3>Description of the dish</h3>
        <p>"Aglio e olio", as it is known in Italy, translates to garlic and oil (olive oil) and it's a very simple recipe that is
            traditionally used with spaghetti! It is deceptively simple but can also be somewhat overwhelming to master for a less
            experienced cook. It consists of a simple pasta water and oil sauce that is flavoured with a lot of garlic (up to taste).
        </p>

        <p> The difficulty of the recipe relies in the speed at which every ingredient needs to be worked, the sauce is cooked in the
            time it takes for the pasta to also cook in the boiling water, it is thus important to not overcook the garlic before the pasta
            is done and also to not have the pasta overcook while the sauce is still cooking.
