        <h3>Description of the dish</h3>

        <h4> <strong>Please read through the whole recipe at least once!</strong></h4>

        <p>"Aglio e olio", as it is known in Italy, translates to garlic and oil (olive oil) and it's a very simple recipe that is
            traditionally used with spaghetti! It is deceptively simple but can also be somewhat overwhelming to master for a less
            experienced cook. It consists of a simple pasta water and oil sauce that is flavoured with a lot of garlic (up to taste).
        </p>

        <p> The difficulty of the recipe relies in the speed at which every ingredient needs to be worked, the sauce is cooked in the
            time it takes for the pasta to also cook in the boiling water, it is thus important to not overcook the garlic before the pasta
            is done and also to not have the pasta overcook while the sauce is still cooking.
        </p>
        <p>Let's jump right into the <strong>ingredients!</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li> - Good quality olive oil (any kind will do, be sure you like the taste!)</li>
            <li> - 2-3 garlic cloves per person (you can increase the number based on preference and garlic strenght)</li>
            <li> - Good quality pasta (the starch from the pasta is going to be very important so choose a good pasta!)</li>
            <li> - (Optional) Red chili flakes or alternatively 1-2 chopped red chili (depending on strenght and and taste)</li>
            <li> - (Optional) Fresh parsley (mostly used as garnish)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Now for the <strong>preparation</strong>!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Put the water for the pasta to boil in a pot of your choosing, be sure to add salt to it (this is the only step where we should
                be adding salt, so be generous as it will affect the taste!)</li>
            <li> Start chopping! Chop the garlic cloves (I suggest not cutting them to small as they will burn faster, cutting the garlic into,
                not too thin, slices is generally the way to go)
            </li>
            <li>Here is the crucial part, put the pasta to boil and be sure to follow cooking time (for this recipe I will assume around 9 minutes).
                Put a good amount of olive oil in the pan (around 1-2 TBs per person) and heat up on middle to high heat, once the oil is hot add the garlic
                and if necessary, lower the heat to middle.
            </li>
            <li> Once the garlic is starting to look golden, or gaining colour in general, it's time to add the chili peppers or flakes, otherwise
                proceed by adding some pasta water (around 2-3 TBs, this can vary A LOT, so experiment and find the amount that works for you), stir in well
                to make sure the sauce thickens somewhat.
            </li>
            <li>When the pasta is ready (it should be ready about 1-2 minutes after you added the water) strain
                it and add the pasta to the pan, stir or play with the pan to <em>ensure that the pasta is coated with the sauce</em>.
            </li>
            <li> (Optional) Have a taste and ensure that it's well flavoured, if not salty enough you can now add some salt, it won't melt
                properly but it will be easier to mix now that the pasta is still hot!
            </li>
            <li> Add the parsley and serve!</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Buon appetito!</strong></p>
