    <h3>Description</h3>

    <h4><strong>Please read through the whole recipe at least once!</strong></h3>

    <p>Early in the morning, or at any time in the morning really, this is my personal favourite way of enjoying coffee, an absolute staple at any
        italian bars in the south and center of Italy. An incredibly simple yet super delicious caffe latte! This is more a recipe to share this simple
        and amazing drink because you won't need much help doing it, given how simple it is!
    </p>

    <p>Now let's jump into the <strong>ingredients</strong>!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground coffee (<em>Any</em> kind will work, ideally pick a flavourful variety) for moka machine. This is how the coffee it's traditionally made, you can probably use any other type of coffee but I cannot
            recommend on the outcome!
        </li>
        <li> Any kind of milk you enjoy, cow milk will of course work but so will soy, oat or any other kind. Ideally pick a milk that has a strong flavour,
            you don't want it to overpower the coffee but it also should not be too light that you won't even taste it.
        </li>
        <li> (Optional) Sugar! Here any kind will do, it's up to you and your flavour preferences! A darker sugar will add flavour tones that a white sugar
            won't, the quantity is also entirely up to personal preference and <em>importantly</em> dependant on the amount of sugar in the milk already.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Let's get to the <strong>preparation</strong>!</p>

    <p>Let's start with the coffe:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> First of all, wash the moka machine well and then dry it immediately or alternatively let it to dry before using it.</li>
        <li> Take the filter away from the bottom piece, and fill the bottom piece with enough water to reach the metal valve</li>
        <li> Put the filter back on and now put in the ground coffee. (Tip: Use a paper towel under the moka to collect any coffee that might fall
            outside of the filter, you can either re-add it to the filter or store it back). <strong>The amount of coffee </strong> you add is dependant
            on taste, ideally you wanna put enough coffee to make a little mound rather than a flat surface, also <em>do not compact or press on the coffee</em>
            this will make it harder for the vapour to go through!</li>
        <li> Screw the top part on and put on the moka on the stove. A small stove at middle to low strenght will be more than enough.</li>
        <li> Once you hear the whistle of the moka, your coffee is done and you can put it aside!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Now for the caffelatte!</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Fill the glass 3/4 or even 5/6 of the way with (<strong>cold or hot</strong>) milk</li>
        <li> On the side pour the coffee in a smaller glass</li>
        <li> Add the sugar of choice to the coffee glass and stir until the sugar is dissolved</li>
        <li> Now, finally, add the coffee to the glass of milk</li>
        <li> Now you can enjoy your caffelatte! Stirring it is not necessary and I enjoy mine as is with a cool marbled look to it!</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Buon appetito</strong>!</p>
