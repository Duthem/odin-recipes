        <h3>Description</h3>

        <h4><strong>Please read through the whole recipe at least once!</strong></h4>

        <p>Ahh, tomato sauce... One of the most fundamental and delicious of italian sauces, one that I certainly make a couple of times at week minimum. Extremely
            versatile and reliable, it can be paired with pasta and rice as is or it can be "reinforced" with chillis to make "arrabbiata" or even meat for
            a more nutritious dish! 
        </p>

        <p>Preparing it won't be very difficult, an important note is that this dish really benefits from cooking over a longer period of time, so ideally even
            though you can make a fire tomato sauce in 20 mins (between chopping and putting it onto the fire) it really helps the flavours to develop if you cook
            it even for 30 mins (time on the stove)! I will be going a basic version with a couple of ideas to make it different and to find the one you love!
        </p>

        <p>Now let's jump into the <strong>ingredients</strong>!</p>

        <ul>
            <li> You are going to need "aromatics" which will build the base of your sauce, these are traditionally <em>garlic or onion</em>, generally
            in Italy, it is not common to mix them both but if that's something you think you would enjoy, than by all means go ahead!</li>
            <li> (Optional) You might consider adding some some chopped <em>carrots</em> to your base or even a <em>celery</em> they are by no means
            necessary, but carrots are relatively commonly used even in a base tomato sauce as they help to balance the acidity of tomatoes</li>
            <li> Tomatoes!!! Here I could write a whole paragraph but the important aspect is to <em>choose your tomatoes carefully</em> and, at least for the first
                times, <strong>use only ONE kind of tomatoes</strong>, be it canned or fresh, it is very important that you don't mix different tomatoes with
                different acidities and taste if you don't feel confident about them!
            </li>
            <li> Finally, you will need a good quality olive oil, here be sure to weight your choice carefully. Not every oil tastes the same and you
                might have a different level of enjoyment of the dish based on how acidic the oil is, how tangy, how mild, etc... 
            </li>
            <li> (Optional) The final touch is herbs, generally tomato sauce is made with basil, which you can omit, but you can even experiment
                with different kinds of basil and even some different herbs. In italy you might probably find a tomato sauce with rosemary <em>OR</em> thyme (although
                they are both very very rare)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's get to the <strong>preparation</strong>!</p>

        <ol>
            <li> Chop your vegetables: Onion, carrots and leek in small cubes; garlic either in small cubes or also left whole;</li>
            <li> Put the oil in the pan and on the fire on a medium-high heat, when the oil is hot add the aromatics. (Tip: the order is usually Carrot>Onion>Garlic>Leek
                but you can also add carrots,leek and onions at the same time, just be sure to keep an eye on them!)
            </li>
            <li> When the aromatics have changed colour (Onion translucent), it is now time to add the tomato puree.
            </li>
            <li>Stir everything well and add some chopped basil or other herb right now. You will want to let this cook on a <strong>low heat
                and with a lid on</strong> for a minimun of 15 minutes, but the longer you can go the better!</li>
            <li>(Optional) Depending on what you used, you can always add some hot water to the sauce if you see that too much water has evaporated!</li>
            <li> Once the sauce is cooked, taste and add salt or black pepper to taste! (Keep on tasting until it's right!)</li>
            <li>(Optional) If you did not use carrots and the sauce tastes acidic, a pinch of white sugar or baking soda will eliminate the problem!</li>
            <li> There you go! The sauce as is can be used in combination with meatballs, pasta, and even bread!</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Buon appetito</strong>!</p>
